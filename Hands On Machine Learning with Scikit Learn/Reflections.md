ðŸ“˜ Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow (2nd Edition) by AurÃ©lien GÃ©ron

This is a personal study repo where I take notes as I work through the book. My goal is to understand ML concepts better and build a review-friendly reference for myself and others. Feel free to follow along, fork, or suggest ideas!

ðŸŽ¯Some Types of Noise in Data

Stochastic Noise: Random variations in data that cannot be explained by input features â€” also known as irreducible error. Itâ€™s unpredictable, not caused by the model, and inherent in real-world data.


Rounding Error: A rounding error is a deterministic type of noise that arises due to limitations in how numbers are stored or represented, especially when working with floating-point numbers. Rounding error occurs when a number cannot be represented exactly in the computer's memory, so it gets rounded to the nearest representable value. Itâ€™s systematic, meaning it's introduced in a predictable, repeatable way.
