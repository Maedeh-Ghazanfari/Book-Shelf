## ðŸ“˜ Machine Learning Yearning - Andrew Ng

### Key Concepts I Learned:

- The difference between training/dev/test sets and their role in model tuning.
- I learned the importance of selecting the development (dev) set and test set from the same data distribution to ensure that model evaluation is fair and reliable. This helps prevent biased results and ensures that performance metrics reflect how the model will behave on new, unseen data.
- The dev set should be large enough to detect differences between algorithms that you are trying out.
