# Book-Shelf: My Machine Learning Notes

Welcome to my personal **Book-Shelf** repository!  

This repo is a collection of notes I take while reading books and learning about machine learning. It helps me organize my thoughts, remember key concepts, and track my progress over time.

## What You’ll Find Here

- Notes on various machine learning topics and algorithms  
- Insights, formulas, and personal reflections  
- Code snippets or examples when relevant  

## How It’s Organized

Each folder or file corresponds to a specific book, chapter, or topic I’m studying. Notes are informal and written in my own words to help with understanding and retention.

## Why I Made This Repo

Learning is a journey, and writing down what I learn helps me internalize the material better. This repository is my digital notebook for that process.
